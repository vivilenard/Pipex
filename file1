I'm feeling mighty lonesome
Haven't slept a wink
I walk the floor and watch the door
And in-between I drink
Black coffee
Love's a hand-me-down blues
I'll never know a Sunday
In this weekday room
I'm talking to the shadows
One o'clock to four
And Lord, how slow the moments go
When all I do is pour
Black coffee
Since the blues caught my light
I'm hanging out on Monday
My Sunday dreams to dry
Now man is born to go loving
A woman's born to weep and fret
To stay at home and tend her oven
And drown her past regrets
In coffee and cigarettes
I'm moaning all the mornin'
Moaning all the night
And in-between it's nicotine
And not much heart to fight
Black coffee
Feel as low as the ground
It's driving me crazy
This waiting for my baby
To maybe come around.
